### Branching

> ***See*** [Git branching workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/fr/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) article and [Branch naming guidelines](https://gist.github.com/revett/88ee5abf5a9a097b4c88).

In order to allow a better collaboration, the git workflow is structured as follow:
- `main` branch is the common development branch, features and bugfix should be merged on this branch.
- `release` branch is used only for stable release, it can be merged only from the `release` branch.
- `hotfix` branch is used to fix bug in production. Commit must include a tag for the version.
- Separate branch for development features and bugfix. Must be merged with the `main` branch. Indicate at the begining of the branch name if it is a feature or a bugfix. 

***Specify in the first or last commit of a new branch, the revelant issue(s).***
